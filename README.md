## Introduction

MCQMaker is a software with a graphical interface that allows you to import, create, modify and manage MCQs in various formats such as text, docx, pdf or xml for Moodle. It is designed to ease and speed-up the creation and the management of MCQs for teachers.

You can create databases with your questions and then generate a MCQ by selecting the number of questions from each database. The resulting MCQ will be exported in the desired format and the questions used will be saved so that you can generate other MCQs with questions from the same database without having duplicated questions.

For example if you want to prepare grammar MCQs, create one database per notion you want your students to practice and then generate exercises mixing those questions together.
