## Introduction

The project is a tool to generate automatically MCQs, in `txt`, `docx`, `xml` and `h5p` formats.

## Architecture of the project

The project is divided into several packages:
- `Classes`, containing the `txt` files automatically generated by the software to store the data of each class.
- `coverage`
- `data`, containing the file `settings.json` where the language of the interface is specified as well as the default template and the codes caracters used for the database. It also contains the *json* files to get the translation of the whole interface in several languages. You may add other files, if you want to translate the interface in another language. It finally contains the folder `configuration` where all configurations created by the user in the application are stored.
- `Export`
- `Instructions`
- `qcm_maker_screens`
- `qcm_maker_tools`
- `Question Database`
- `resources`, containing the following folders:
  - `fill-in-the-blanks`
  - `images_documentation`, containing the images used in the instruction manuals and in the readme.
  - `kivy`, containing the styling files of the interface, using the *Python* graphic librairy *Kivy*.
  - `single-choice`
- `Templates`, containing the templates you want to use for the generation in `docx` format. By default, it contains only one template, explaining the conventions but you may add other to change style.
- `test`, containing tests functions for the backend.

It also contains the following file:
- `MCQMaker.kv`, *Kivy* file containing the graphics of the interface, which is linked to the module `MCQMaker.py`.
- `MCQMaker.py`, main module to launch to execute the code.
- `requirements.txt`
